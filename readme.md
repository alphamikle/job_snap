JobSnap is an Open Source and free browser extension that allows you to very quickly copy detailed info about a job you're about to apply for on LinkedIn:

Searching for jobs on LinkedIn can be very tedious. In addition, to have an idea of the success of your efforts, you need to build a search funnel - how many responses were made, how many responses did you get, which company and position did you apply to, how many technical interviews did you have, and how many offers did you end up getting?

JobSnap extension was created to simplify the process of building the funnel! I am a software developer myself and I know from my own experience how much time it takes to put everything in order and not forget anything. At some point I got tired of adding all the data to Google Sheet manually. So I decided to make a simple and effective tool for this task. That's exactly what JobSnap is: simple, fast, and useful.

How should you use JobSnap? Below you will find a link to a Google Sheets template that already has the required fields and automatic formatting set up. You need to copy this file to yourself, and start filling it with data. Then, you find the job you are interested in through the LinkedIn search, respond, press "Ctrl+E" or "Command+E" and all the important information about the position, such a company name, company profile link, job title, position link, salary range, and the current date will be copied to the clipboard. After that you just need to paste it into Google Sheets in a new line. After a while - you will receive rejections or invitations for technical interviews - just fill in the corresponding cell in Google Sheets and get your own success funnel.
